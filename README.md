## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

## üßÆ Core Calculations

* **Accumulation Phase:** A compound interest formula is applied monthly, factoring in monthly contributions and an annual increase in those contributions.
* **Drawdown Phase:** A present value of an annuity formula is used to calculate the required nest egg (Retirement Goal). This calculation accounts for post-retirement returns and inflation to determine how much is needed to fund the desired annual spending.
* **Goal Seeking:** The analysis tools use iterative algorithms (binary search for savings, linear search for age) to find the input values that satisfy the retirement goal.
